## Introduction

This repository includes a collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in Java. The goal is to provide clear and concise examples to help understand the concepts and their applications.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `src/main/java/`: Contains the main Java source files.
- `src/test/java/`: Contains the test files.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-structures-algorithms-class.git
   cd data-structures-algorithms-class

2. Open the project in your preferred IDE. Bellow there are some options:
